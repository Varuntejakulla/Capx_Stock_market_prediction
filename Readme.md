Stock Market Prediction using Sentiment Analysis
Overview
This project involves predicting stock market movements by analyzing tweets and their associated sentiments. The model is trained on a dataset of tweets, which include stock-related keywords. It leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as TF-IDF and sentiment analysis to enhance the prediction accuracy.

Features
Sentiment Analysis: Analyzes the sentiment of each tweet to predict whether it will positively or negatively impact stock movement.
Stock Market Keyword Matching: Automatically identifies stock market-related tweets and adjusts the prediction.
NLP Preprocessing: Uses TF-IDF vectorization for converting text data into numerical format for model training and predictions.
Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
Python 3.7 or higher
The following Python packages:
pandas
scikit-learn
joblib
scipy
Install the required dependencies using the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
(Note: Create a requirements.txt with the necessary libraries if it does not exist already.)

Project Files
Training Data: The training data is located in the data files/processed_with_sentiment_train.csv, which contains columns:

Date: The date of the tweet.
Tweet: The tweet content.
Sentiment: Sentiment score of the tweet (generated via sentiment analysis).
Test Data: The test data is located in data files/processed_with_sentiment_test.csv.

Trained Model: The trained stock prediction model is saved in models/stock_prediction_model.pkl. The trained TF-IDF vectorizer is stored in models/tfidf_vectorizer.pkl.

Training the Model
The script src/Model.py is responsible for training the stock market movement prediction model.

Run the model training:
bash
Copy code
python src/Model.py
This will:

Load the training data from processed_with_sentiment_train.csv.
Train a logistic regression model using TF-IDF features combined with sentiment data.
Save the trained model and vectorizer in the models/ directory.
Testing the Model
The script src/testmodel.py tests the trained model on new test data and generates predictions.

Run the test script:
bash
Copy code
python src/testmodel.py
This will:

Load the test data from processed_with_sentiment_test.csv.
Generate predictions using the trained model.
Automatically correct predictions for tweets containing stock market-related keywords.
Save the corrected predictions to test_predictions_with_correction.csv.
Keyword-Based Prediction Correction
The script includes a mechanism that automatically corrects predictions for tweets containing stock-related keywords (such as "StockMarket," "Nifty," etc.) by forcing them to be classified as stock-related.

This helps in improving the accuracy of predictions when dealing with ambiguous cases.

Output
After running the testmodel.py script, the predictions will be saved to test_predictions_with_correction.csv. The columns include:

Date: Date of the tweet.
Tweet: The tweet content.
Sentiment: The sentiment score of the tweet.
Corrected_Predictions: The predicted stock movement after correction for stock-related keywords.
